## Description

My motivation for completing this project was the hard challenge of learning something I never thought I would be able to do. This guide can help solve all the questions and problems you had about the prework bootcamp. I learned a lot about coding from this prework study guide, from practicing what it takes to set up a project in Git and Github, to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this study guide has all the information and tools to become a beginner coder.
